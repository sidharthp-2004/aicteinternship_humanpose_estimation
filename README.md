## About the Project

Human pose estimation is a computer vision technique that predicts the positions of key body joints (e.g., elbows, knees, shoulders). This project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in pose detection.

## Features

- Detects key body points in real-time.
- Supports single-person and multi-person pose estimation.
- Flexible input sources (images, videos, webcam).
- Easy integration with downstream applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Models**: Pre-trained models like OpenPose, PoseNet, or custom-trained models.

## Getting Started

    ### Steps Involved in Human Pose Estimation
    1. **Input Preprocessing**:
        - Resize and normalize the input image.
        - Convert image into a format suitable for the model.
    2. **Pose Detection**:
        - Use a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., OpenPose, PoseNet) to detect body keypoints.
    3. **Post-Processing**:
        - Generate heatmaps and connect keypoints to form the skeletal structure.
    4. **Output Visualization**:
        - Overlay detected keypoints and skeleton on the input image or video.
